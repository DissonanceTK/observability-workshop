## 1. Find the web (URL) of your Workshop Host's Online Boutique

As discussed in the previous section  we are going to use the Online Boutique of the Workshop host EC2 instance's IP address.

We are all connecting to the Online Boutique of the workshops host for this RUM session as this will create more traffic from multiple locations, making the data more realistic.

Open a new web browser and go to `http://{==WORKSHOP-HOST-EC2-IP==}:81/` where you will then be able to see the RUM enabled Online Boutique running.
