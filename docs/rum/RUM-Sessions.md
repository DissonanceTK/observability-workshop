## 2. Drill down in the Sessions

After you have analyzed the  information and drilled down via the Tag Spotlight to a sub set of the traces, , you can view the actual session as it was run by the end-users browser.
 
You do this by clicking on the link **Example Sessions** as shown below:

This will give you a list of sessions that matched both the time filter and the subset selected in the Tag Profile.

Select one  by clicking on the session ID, It is a good idea to select one that has the longes duration.
