# Introduction

Splunk RUM is is the industry’s only end to end, full fidelity Real User Monitoring and troubleshooting solution built to optimize performance and troubleshoot faster,
giving visibility into end-user experiences.

What this means is that you can view latency from web browsers, through your database calls, and everything in between. You can identify performance problems in your page loads, and measure how slow backend service performance impacts your customer experience.

You can benchmark and improve page performance with core web vitals, W3C timings, identifying longtasks, and everything that impacts your page load experience.

And for data, we don’t sample, we’re framework agnostic, we’re OpenTelemetry standardized, and we capture full user sessions...all of this means you can measure all user interactions and dynamic components of your modern applications

Simulair to Splunk APM  the Frontend and back end application performance are interdependent. To see the full picture, Splunk RUM provides seamless correlation between your front end and the microservices running behind it. If your application acts out because of an issue related to the microservices, or the infra structure they are running on, Splunk will let you know. To complete the picture, in-context access to Splunk logs and events enable deeper troubleshooting and root-cause analysis.
