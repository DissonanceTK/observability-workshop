# Using Formulas

## 1. Plotting differences

Let's now plot the difference of all metric values for a day with 7 days in between.

Click on **Enter Formula**{: .label-button .sfx-ui-button-blue} then enter **`A-B`** (A minus B) and hide (deselect) all Signals using the eye, except **C**.

We now see only the difference of all metric values of **A** and **B** being plotted. We see that we have some negative values on the plot because a metric value of **B** has some times larger value than the metric value of **A** at that time.

Click on **DATA TABLE** and in that view swipe horizontally along the X axis to see the metric values at different times.

## 2. Saving our chart
