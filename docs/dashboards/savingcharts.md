# Saving charts

## 1. Creating your own dashboard

To start saving your chart, lets give it a name and description.

Change the name of the Dashboard from "*Copy of Latency histogram*" to **"Active Latency"**.

Change the description from "*Spread of latency values across time.*" to **"Overview of latency values in realtime."** .

Press the **Save As Button**{: .label-button .sfx-ui-button-blue} to begin saving your chart.
