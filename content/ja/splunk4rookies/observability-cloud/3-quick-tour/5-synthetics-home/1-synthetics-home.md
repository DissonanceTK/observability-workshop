Click on **Synthetics** in the main menu. This will bring us to the Synthetics Home Page. It has 3 distinct sections that provide either useful information or allow you to pick or create a Synthetic Test.

1. **Onboarding Pane:** Training videos and links to documentation to get you started with Splunk Synthetics.
2. **Test Pane:** List of all the tests that are configured (**Browser**, **API** and **Uptime**)
3. **Create Test Pane:** Drop-down for creating new Synthetic tests.

As part of the workshop we have created a default browser test against the application we are running. You find it in the Test Pane (**2**). It will have the following name **Workshop Browser Test for**, followed by the name of your Workshop (your instructor should have provided that to you).

To continue our tour, let's look at the result of our workshop's automatic browser test.

* In the Test Pane, click on the line that contains the name of your workshop. The result should look like this:

* Note, On the Synthetic Tests Page, the first pane will show the performance of your site for the last day, 8 days and 30 days. As shown in the screenshot above, only if a test started far enough in the past, the corresponding chart will contain valid data. For the workshop, this depends on when it was created.
* In the Performance KPI drop-down, change the time from the default 4 hours to the 1 last hour.
