![APM Tag Spotlight](../images/apm-tag-spotlight.png)

There are two views available in **Tag Spotlight**. The default is **Request/Errors** and the other is **Latency**.

Request/Error charts display the total number of requests, errors, and root cause errors. The Latency charts display p50, p90, and p99 latency. These values are based on Troubleshooting MetricSets (TMS), which Splunk APM generates for every indexed span tag. These are known as RED metrics (request, error, and duration).
