As we already saved some useful log charts in a dashboard in the Log Observer exercise, we are going to extend that dashboard.

* To get back to your dashboard with the two log charts, click on **Dashboards** from the main menu and you will be taken to your Team Dashboard view. Under **Dashboards** click in **Search dashboards** to search for your Service Health Dashboard group. 
* Click on the name and this will bring up your previously saved dashboard.

* Even if the log information is useful, it will need more information to have it make sense for our team so let's add a bit more information
* The first step is adding a description chart to the dashboard. Click on the {{% button style="grey" %}}New text note{{% /button %}} and replace the text in the note with the following text and then click the {{% button style="blue" %}}Save and close{{% /button %}} button and name the chart **Instructions**

* The charts are not in a nice order, let's correct that and rearrange the charts so that they are useful.
* Move your mouse over the top edge of the **Instructions** chart, your mouse pointer will change to a **â˜©**. This will allow you to drag the chart in the dashboard. Drag the **Instructions** chart to the top left location and resize it to a 1/3rd of the page by dragging the right-hand edge.
* Drag and add the **Log Timeline view** chart next to the **Instruction** chart, resize it so it fills the other 2/3rd of the page to be the error rate chart next to the two the chart and resize it so it fills the page
* Next, resize the **Log lines** chart to be the width of the page and resize it the make it at least twice as long.
* You should have something similar to the dashboard below:

This looks great, let's continue and add more meaningful charts.
