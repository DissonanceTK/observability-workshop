This workshop will equip you with the basic understanding of monitoring Kubernetes using the Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector. During the workshop you will deploy PHP/Apache and a load generator.

You will learn about OpenTelemetry Receivers, Kubernetes Namespaces, ReplicaSets, Kubernetes Horizontal Pod AutoScaling and how to monitor all this using the Splunk Observability Cloud. The main learnings from the workshop will be a better understanding of the Kubernetes Navigator (and Dashboards) in Splunk Observability Cloud. Along, with seeing Kubernetes metrics, events and Auto-Detectors.

In order to part take in this workshop you will need to have a access to a Splunk Observability Cloud account in US Splunk Show, your laptop and hopefully a stable wi-fi connection.

In preparation for the workshop, Splunk has prepared an Ubuntu Linux instance in AWS/EC2.

To get access to the instance that you will be using in the workshop please visit the URL to access the Google Sheet provided by the workshop leader.
