## Introduction

During this technical workshop you will learn how to:

- efficiently deploy complex environments
- capture metrics from these environments to Splunk Observability Cloud
- auto-instrument a python application
- enabling OS logging to Splunk Enterprise via Universal Forwarder

In order to simplify the workshop modules, a pre-configured AWS EC2 instance is provided.

By the end of this technical workshop you will have an approach to demonstrating metrics collection for complex environments and services.
