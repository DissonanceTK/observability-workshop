Now that we have seen trends and changes, let's make it easier to know when something unexpected happens.

Create a detector based on the LCP chart on your dashboard.

When you get to the Alert Settings step, change the time frame to -1d and wait for the alert preview to see how you might want to adjust the settings to get more or less alert noise.

Proceed through the alert setup to see what options are available. You can save the detector **without adding additional recipients** (so your inbox doesn't get flooded!)
