First set the time for the chart to -1 hour in the Time box at the top right of the chart. Then to make this a different chart, click on the eye icon in front of signal "*A*" to make it visible again, and then hide signal "*C*" via the eye icon and change the name for *Latency history* to **Latency vs Load**.
