In order to simplify the overall experience we will provide you hands on deck to the actual environment where we have the Online Boutique store instrumented via Splunk. This application is written in Java and has microservice architecture



The workshops also introduce you to dashboards, editing and creating charts, creating detectors to fire alerts, Monitoring as Code and the Service Bureau[^6]

By the end of these technical workshops you will have a good understanding of some of the key features and capabilities of the Splunk Observability Cloud.

[^1]: [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/) is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation.
[^2]: The OpenTelemetry Collector offers a vendor-agnostic implementation on how to receive, process and export telemetry data. In addition, it removes the need to run, operate and maintain multiple agents/collectors in order to support open-source telemetry data formats (e.g. Jaeger, Prometheus, etc.) sending to multiple open-source or commercial back-ends.
[^3]: NGINX is a web server that can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy and HTTP cache.
[^4]: [Kubernetes ReplicaSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/)
[^5]: Jaeger, inspired by Dapper and OpenZipkin, is a distributed tracing system released as open source by Uber Technologies. It is used for monitoring and troubleshooting microservices-based distributed systems
