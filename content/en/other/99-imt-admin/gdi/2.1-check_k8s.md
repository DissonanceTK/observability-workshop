## 1. Validate metrics in the UI

In the Splunk UI, make sure the Left Hand menu is visible, (if it's not, click on the **<** at the bottom left of the page), then click on **Infrastructure**  **(1)**.

![Selecting the Kubernetes Navigator Map](../../images/clustermap-nav.png)

Under **Containers** select **Kubernetes** **(2)**, then click on the Kubernetes Node pane **(3)** to open the Kubernetes view.

![find my cluster](../../images/find_k3s_cluster.png)

Validate that your cluster is discovered and reported by finding your cluster (in the workshop you will see many other clusters). To find your cluster name run the following command and copy the output to your clipboard:

{{% tab title="Echo Cluster Name" %}}

```bash
echo $INSTANCE-k3s-cluster
```

{{% /tab %}}

Then in the UI, click on the {{% button %}}Add filters{{% /button %}} button **(1)**. Type in `k8s.cluster.name` and click on the search result.  
From the list, select **[NAME OF WORKSHOP]-k3s-cluster** then click on the {{% button style="blue" %}}Apply Filter{{% /button %}} button.

To examine the health of your cluster,  you can look ay the various charts in the Kubernetes Navigator that use data streaming from your cluster though the Splunk distribution of the OpenTelemetery collector.
you can see Node related info, like CPU and memory usage, Disk utilization, log events. Take a minute to look at the various metrics and log generated by your cluster.

[^1]: Access Tokens (sometimes called Org Tokens) are long-lived organization-level tokens. By default, these tokens persist for 5 years and thus are suitable for embedding into emitters that send data points over long periods, or for any long-running scripts that call the Splunk API.

[^2]: A realm is a self-contained deployment of Splunk in which your Organization is hosted. Different realms have different API endpoints (e.g. the endpoint for sending data is `ingest.us1.signalfx.com` for the **`us1`** realm and `ingest.eu0.signalfx.com` for the **`eu0`** realm). This realm name is shown on your profile page in the Splunk UI. If you do not include the realm name when specifying an endpoint, Splunk will interpret it as pointing to the **`us0`** realm.
