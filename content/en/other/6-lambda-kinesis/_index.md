This workshop will equip you with how a distributed trace is constructed for a small serverless application that runs on AWS Lambda, producing and consuming a message via AWS Kinesis.

We will see how auto-instrumentation works with manual steps to force a Producer function's context to be sent to Consumer function via a Record put on a Kinesis stream.

For this workshop Splunk has prepared an Ubuntu Linux instance in AWS/EC2 all pre-configured for you.

To get access to the instance that you will be using in the workshop, please visit the URL provided by the workshop leader.d
