## Rebuild and Deploy

* Run

``` bash
./BuildAndDeploy.sh
```

* Wait a few minutes . . .
* Return to the service map

If you do NOT see RED in your service map, you have completed the Latency Repair for the Colorado Location!

Now let's check for our exception in the traces.

* Click on shop service
* Click Traces (on the right side)
* Click Errors Only

If you do not have red in your service map and you do not see Errors in traces, you have successfully completed our Inventory application review for Sri Lanka and Colorado locations.

**Well done!**
