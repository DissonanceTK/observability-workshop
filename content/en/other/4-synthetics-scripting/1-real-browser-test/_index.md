## Introduction

This workshop walks you through using the [Chrome DevTools Recorder](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/recorder/) to create a synthetic transaction against a Splunk demonstration instance.

The exported JSON from the Chrome DevTools Recorder will then be used to create a Splunk Synthetic Monitoring Real Browser Test.

In addition, you will also get to learn other Splunk Synthetic Monitoring checks like [API Test](https://docs.splunk.com/Observability/synthetics/api-test/api-test.html) and [Uptime Test](https://docs.splunk.com/Observability/synthetics/uptime-test/uptime-test.html).

## Pre-requisites

- Google Chrome Browser installed
- Access to Splunk Observability Cloud
