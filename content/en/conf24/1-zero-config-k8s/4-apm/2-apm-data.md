Change the **Environment** filter **(1)** to the name of your workshop instance in the dropdown box (this will be **`<INSTANCE>-workshop`** where **`INSTANCE`** is the value from the shell script you ran earlier) and make sure it is the only one selected.

![apm](../../images/zero-config-first-services-overview.png)

You will see the name **(2)** of the **api-gateway** service and metrics in the Latency and Request & Errors charts (you can ignore the Critical Alert, as it is caused by the sudden request increase generated by the load generator). You will also see the rest of the services appear.

Click on **(3)** to load the **Service Map**.
