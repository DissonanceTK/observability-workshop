As we have seen in the previous section, once you enable **Zero-Config Auto-Instrumentation** on your services traces are sent to **Splunk Observability Cloud**.

With these traces, Splunk will automatically generate Dependency Maps and RED Metrics. In this next section, we are going to examine the traces themselves and what information they provide to help you understand the behavior of your services all without touching your code.

Make sure you are on the APM Explorer page either by going back in the browser or navigating to the **APM** ![APM](../images/apm-icon.png?classes=inline&height=25px) section in the Menu bar, then click on the **Explore** tile.
