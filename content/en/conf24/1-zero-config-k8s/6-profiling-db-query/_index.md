As we have seen in the previous chapter, you can trace your interactions between the various services using APM without touching your code, which will allow you to identify issues faster. However as seen, besides tracing, Splunk Zero Config for Auto-Instrumentations offers additional features out of the box that can help you find issues faster. In this section we are going to look at 2 of them:

* Always-on Profiling and Java Metrics
* Database Query Performance

If you want to dive deeper into Always-on Profiling or DB-Query performance, we have a separate Ninja Workshop called ***Debug Problems*** that you can follow for more detailed info.
