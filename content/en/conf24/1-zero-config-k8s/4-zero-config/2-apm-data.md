Wait for the pods to turn green again (you may want to refresh the screen), then navigate to **APM** ![APM](../../images/apm-icon.png?classes=inline&height=25px) to see the data generated by the traces from the auto-instrumented services.

Change the **Environment** filter **(1)** to the name of your workshop instance from the dropdown box, it will be **`<INSTANCE>-workshop`** (where **`INSTANCE`** is the value from the shell script you ran earlier). Make sure it is the only one selected.

You will see the name **(2)** of the **api-gateway** service and metrics in the Latency and Request & Errors charts (you can ignore the Critical Alert, as it was caused by the sudden request increase generated by the load generator). You will also see the rest of the services appear.
