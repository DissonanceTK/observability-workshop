Once the containers are patched they will be restarted, let's go back to the **Splunk Observability Cloud** with the URL provided by the Instructor to check our cluster in the Kubernetes Navigator.

After a couple of minutes or so you should see that the Pods are being restarted by the operator and the Zero config container will be added. This will look similar to the screenshot below:

![restart](../../images/k8s-navigator-restarted-pods.png)

Wait for the pods to turn green again (you may want to refresh the screen), then navigate to the **APM** ![APM](../images/apm-icon.png?classes=inline&height=25px) section to look at the information provided by the traces generated from your service in the **Explore** Pane. Use the filter option to change the *environment* filter **(1)** and search for the name of your workshop instance in the dropdown box, it should be the [INSTANCE]-workshop. (where `INSTANCE` is the value from the shell script you run earlier). Make sure it is the only one selected.

You should see the name **(2)** of the api-gateway service and metrics in the Latency and Request & Errors charts. (You can ignore the Critical Alert, as it was caused by the sudden request increase generated by the load generator, It will become the norm in a bit and go away). You should also see the rest of the service appear.

Next, click on **Explore** **(3)** to see the services in the automatically generated dependency map and select the api-gateway service.

The example above shows all the interactions between all our services. You may still be showing the map in the interim state as it will take the Petclinic Microservice application a few minutes to start up and fully synchronize to make your map to look like the one above. Reducing the time will help, if you pick a custom time of 2 minutes, the initial startup-related errors (Red Dots) will disappear from the view.

In the meantime let's examine the metrics that are available for each service that is instrumented and visit the request, error, and duration (RED) metrics Dashboard
