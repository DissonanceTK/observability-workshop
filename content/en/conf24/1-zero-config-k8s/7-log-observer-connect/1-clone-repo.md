First, clone the PetClinic GitHub repository, as we will need this later in the workshop to compile, build, package and containerize the application:

```bash
cd ~;git clone https://github.com/hagen-p/spring-petclinic-microservices.git
```

Then change into the `spring-petclinic-microservices` directory:

```bash
cd ~/spring-petclinic-microservices
```
