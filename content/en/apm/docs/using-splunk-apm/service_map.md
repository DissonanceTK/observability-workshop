## Service Map

Click on **paymentservice** in the service map and select **version** from the `breakdown` drop down filter underneath **paymentservice**. This will filter our service map by the custom span tag **version**.

You will now see the service map has been updated like the below screenshot to show the different versions of the **paymentservice**.
