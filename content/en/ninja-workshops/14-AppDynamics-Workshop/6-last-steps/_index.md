You have recently installed AppDynamics on the Supercar-Trader application and are now scheduled to run a PoV playback with the Head of IT and the CIO. The Head of IT has some visibility over what youâ€™ve done to date and has been supportive throughout the sales cycle. He helped set up the meeting with the CIO.

The CIO is the decision maker whom you have not met yet. The goal of this 45 minutes meeting is to playback the value you believe AppDynamics can bring to their organisation based on the recent installation. Leading up to and during the POV you heard the following challenges that you believe AppDynamics can help with.

You can use the three challenges listed below to help you create your presentation from the PoV Playback PPT Template provided here

- Challenge 1: Teams are reactive to incidents and struggle with RCA
- Challenge 2: Inefficiencies in testing cycle
- Challenge 3: Difficult to understand the impact that performance challenges have on the business.
