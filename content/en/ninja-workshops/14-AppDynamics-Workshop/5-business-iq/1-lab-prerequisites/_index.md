In this exercise you will complete the following tasks:

*   Access your AppDynamics Controller from your web browser.
*   Verify transaction load to the application.
*   Restart the application and transaction load if needed.

## Login to your controller

**2.** Verify you see the five different Tiers on the flow map.

**3.** Verify there has been consistent load over the last 1 hour.

## Restart the application and transaction load if needed

If any of the checks you performed in the previous steps could not be verified, SSH into your **Application VM** and follow these steps to restart the application and transaction load.

Use the following commands to stop the running instance of Apache Tomcat.

``` bash
cd /usr/local/apache/apache-tomcat-9/bin
./shutdown.sh
```

Use the command below to check for remaining application JVMs still running.

``` bash
ps -ef | grep Supercar-Trader
```

If you find any remaining application JVMs still running, kill the remaining JVMs using the command below.

``` bash
sudo pkill -f Supercar-Trader
```

Use the following commands to stop the load generation for the application.

``` bash
cd /opt/appdynamics/lab-artifacts/phantomjs
./stop_load.sh
```

You should see output similar to the following image.

Now use the following commands to start Apache Tomcat.

``` bash
cd /usr/local/apache/apache-tomcat-9/bin
./startup.sh
```

Wait for two minutes and use the following command to ensure Apache Tomcat is running on port 8080.

``` bash
sudo netstat -tulpn | grep LISTEN
```

You should see output similar to the following image showing that port 8080 is in use by Apache Tomcat.
