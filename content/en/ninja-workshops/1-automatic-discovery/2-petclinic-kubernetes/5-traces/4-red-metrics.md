Splunk APM provide **Service Centric Views** that provide engineers a deep understanding of service performance in one centralized view. Now, across every service, engineers can quickly identify errors or bottlenecks from a serviceâ€™s underlying infrastructure, pinpoint performance degradation from new deployments, and visualize the health of every third party dependency.

To see this dashboard for the `api-gateway`, click on **APM** from the left-hand menu and then click on the `api-gateway` service in the list. This will bring you to the Service Centric View dashboard:

This view, which is available for each of your instrumented services, offers an overview of **Service metrics**, **Error breakdown**, **Runtime metrics (Java)** and **Infrastructure metrics**.
