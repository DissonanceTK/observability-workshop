description: By the end of this workshop you'll have gotten hands-on experience instrumenting a .NET application with OpenTelemetry, then Dockerizing the application and deploying it to Kubernetes.  You’ll also gain experience deploying the OpenTelemetry collector using Helm, customizing the collector configuration, and troubleshooting collector configuration issues.

In this workshop, you'll get hands-on experience with the following: 

* Practice deploying the collector and instrumenting a .NET application with the Splunk distribution of OpenTelemetry .NET in Linux and Kubernetes environments.
* Practice “dockerizing” a .NET application, running it in Docker, and then adding Splunk OpenTelemetry instrumentation.
* Practice deploying the Splunk distro of the collector in a K8s environment using Helm.  Then customize the collector config and troubleshoot an issue.

The workshop uses a simple .NET application to illustrate these concepts.  Let's get started!
