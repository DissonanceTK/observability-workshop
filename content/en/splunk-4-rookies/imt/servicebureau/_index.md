You will see various dashboards such as Throttling, System Limits, Entitlements & Engagement. The workshop organization you're using now may have less data to work with as this is cleared down after each workshop.

In this dashboard group there are a number of dashboards that will help you understand how your organization is being used:

* APM entitlements
* APM throttling
* IMM entitlements
* IMM system limits
* IMM throttling
* Cloud integrations

Take a minute to explore the various dashboards and charts in the Organization Overview of this workshop instance.

## 2. Subscription Usage

If you want to see what your usage is against your subscription you can select **Subscription Usage**.

This screen may take a few seconds to load whilst it calculates and pulls in the usage. This will give you an overview of the current usage, the average usage and your entitlement per category: Hosts, Containers, Custom Metrics and High Resolution Metrics for Splunk IM.

For more information about these categories please refer to [Infrastructure Monitoring subscription usage](https://docs.splunk.com/Observability/admin/monitor-imm-billing-usage.html).

## 3. Examine usage in detail

The top chart shows you the current subscription levels per category. These are highlighted in red at the top of car column.

Also, your current usage of the four catagories is displayed (shown at the red lines at the bottom of the chart).

In the chart below you can see that there are **2**/200 Hosts, **20**/4,000 Containers, **211**/40,000 Custom Metrics and **0**/10,0000 High Resolution Metrics.

In the bottom chart, you can see the usage per category for the current period (shown in the drop-down box on the top right of the chart).

The blue line marked **Average Usage** indicates what Observability Cloud will use to calculate your average usage for the current Subscription Usage Period.

{{% notice title="Info" style="info" %}}
As you can see from the screenshot, Observability Cloud does not use High Watermark or P95% for cost calculation but the actual average hourly usage, allowing you to do performance testing or Blue/Green style deployments etc. without the risk of overage charges.

To get a feel for the options you can change the metric displayed by selecting the different options from the **Usage Metric** drop down on the left, or change the **Subscription Usage Period** with the drop down on the right.

Finally, the pane on the right shows you information about your Subscription.
