By clicking into the checkout process in the Highest P75 Page Load times you can see I am taken to the tag spotlight view, filtered down to the /cart/checkout process showing me all the tags associated with every user session such as browser, version, city, state and much more. I can also change this tag spotlight view to break this data down by any of the metrics available. 

In this graph at the top of the page I can see that there are some alarming page load times.
