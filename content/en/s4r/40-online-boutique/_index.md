The purpose of this exercise is for you to interact with the Online Boutique web application.  This is a sample application that is used to demonstrate the capabilities of Splunk Observability Cloud. The application is a simple e-commerce site that allows you to browse items, add them to your cart, and then checkout.

The application will already be deployed for you and your instructor will provide you with a link to the Online Boutique website.

## Let's go shopping

Once you have the link to the Online Boutique have a browse through a few items, add them to your cart and then, finally, checkout.

Repeat this exercise a few times and if possible use different browsers, mobile devices or tablets as this will generate more data for you to explore. Also, when using your mouse/touchpad to navigate accentuate your clicks and scrolls.

{{% notice icon="question-circle" style="green" title="Question" %}}
Did you notice anything about the checkout process? Did it seem to take a while to complete, but it did ultimately complete? Or did you plain give up?
{{% /notice %}}

If your order is completed, please copy the **Order Confirmation ID** and save it locally somewhere as we will need it later.

This is what a poor user experience can feel like and since this is a potential customer satisfaction issue we had better jump on this and troubleshoot.

Letâ€™s go take a look at what the data looks like in **Splunk RUM**.
