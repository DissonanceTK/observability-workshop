#### 1. Introduction

The goal of this workshop is to experience an issue and use Splunk Observability Cloud to troubleshoot the issue and identify the route cause. For this we have provided you with a complete application that includes a frontend and a number of backend services that have been instrumented to send **metrics, traces and logs**.

#### 2. Splunk Observability & OpenTelemetry

A Quick intro in **why OpenTelemetry** and why is it mportant for Observability.

#### 3. A tour of the Splunk Observability User Interface

We will take you through the various components of the Splunk Observability Suite, and show you how to easily navigate the 5 main components (**Infrastructure, RUM, APM, Logs and Synthetics**).

This will give you the highlights and is designed to make the rest of the workshop simpler as you are already familiar with the locations of various components.

#### 4. Using the Online Boutique Website to create traffic

Next, we encourage you to enjoy some retail therapy using the Online Boutique Website. Please use your browser, mobile or tablet to spend some hard earn virtual money and help generate some traffic that will send **metrics (we have a problem), traces (where is the problem) and logs (what is the problem)**. We will use this data to find and identify the cause of the underlying issue.

#### 5. Splunk Real User Monitoring

During this session we will examine the Real User data that has been provided by the telemetry received from **you** and other attendees browser sessions.

The goal is to find and identify the activity you created with your **own browser, mobile or tablet** and begin the troubleshooting process.

#### 6. Splunk Application Performance Monitoring

Discover the power of **full end-to-end visibility** by jumping from **your** RUM trace (frontend) to **your** APM trace (backend).

All the services are sending telemetry (traces and spans) that Splunk Observability Cloud can visualise, analyse and use to detect anomalies and errors.

#### 7. Using Logs with Splunk Log Observer

Related Content is a powerful feature that allows you to jump from one component to another. In this case we will jump from the APM trace to the logs that are related to the trace, **your** trace.

#### 8. Splunk Synthetics

Wouldn't it be great if we could have **24/7** monitoring of our application, and be **alerted** when there is a problem?

This is where Synthetics comes in. We will show you a simple test that will run every 5 minutes and check the health of a typical user journey through the Online Boutique.

#### 9. Wrapping up

Last but not least we will show some of the other features that are helpful in finding problems before closing the session.
