After you register and log into the Splunk Observability UI, as described [here](../2-initial-tour/), you will be taken to the Splunk Observability Cloud Home Page. This Home or Landing page has 6 distinct sections that provides either useful information or allows you to navigate Splunk Observability Cloud.

![home page](../images/home-screen.png?width=30vw)

1. **Explore Data Pane:** Here you can see what functions of the Suite are active and you can add additional integrations.
2. Onboarding Pane. Here you will find videos and references to document pages of interest. (Can be toggled on/off by selecting **Hide Onboarding Content** from the ![hamburger-menu](../../images/hamburger-menu-icon.png?classes=inline&height=25px) menu button at the end of the Explore Data Pane, if space is at a premium)
3. **Recent Pane:** This pane shows your recently created or visited Dashboards or Detectors for easy access.
4. **Main Menu Pane:** This pane allows for quick movement between the components of the Splunk Observability Suite.
5. **Org Switcher Pane:** allows for switching between different organisations, if you are a member of more than one Org.
6. **Expand Menu Pane:** This pane allows you to expand the Main menu from icon mode to full mode and vice versa.

Let's do an exercise to get familiar with the menu behaviour, and let's play with some of the UI settings.

* Expand the main menu, check the drop-down box in Org Switcher Pane at the top to see if you have more than one Org assigned to you.
* Click on ![Settings](../images/settings-icon.png?classes=inline&height=25px) in the main menu.
* Select the ![Onboarding](../images/onboarding-icon.png?classes=inline&height=25px)option.  This will open a dialog that allows you to toggle the visibility of the onboarding panes on and off.
* Give it a try, hide  the Home page content.
* At the bottom of the menu, click on either **Light**, **Dark** or **Auto** mode.
* Did you also notice this is where the  Sign out ![Sign Out](../images/sign-out-icon.png?classes=inline&height=25px) option is?
* Click ![Back to menu](../images/back-main-menu.png?classes=inline&height=25px) to go back to the Main Menu.

To see what the Splunk Observability Suite does with Traces from your application(s), let's check out the Application Performance Monitoring or APM for short on the next page.
