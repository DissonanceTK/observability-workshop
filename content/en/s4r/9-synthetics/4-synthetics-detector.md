Given you can run these tests 24/7, it is an ideal tool to get warned early if your test are failing or starting to run longer then your agreed SLA
instead of getting informed by social media, or Uptime web site's.

 To stop that from happening lets detect if our test are taking more then 1.1 minute.

* Set trigger threshold to be around 68000.  Make sure te threshold line is cutting though the long spikes as shown above. (You may have to adjust the threshold value a bit to match your actual latency.)
* Leave the rest as default.
* Note that there are now a row of red and white triangles appeared  below hte spikes. The Red Triangle lets you know the your detector found that your test was above the given threshold & the white triangle indicates the that the result returned to below the threshold. Each red Triangle will trigger an alert.
