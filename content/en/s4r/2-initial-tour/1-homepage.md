After you registered and logged into the Splunk Observability UI, as described [here](../2-initial-tour/), you will be taken to the Observability Suite Home Page. This Home or Landing page has 6 distinct section that provide either useful information or allows you to navigate the Splunk Observability Suite.

1. Explore Data Pane, Here you can see what function of the Suite are active and you can add additional integrations.
2. Onboarding Pane, Here you will find video's and references to document pages of interest. (Can be toggled on/off by selecting **Hide Onboarding Content** from the ![hamburger-menu](../../images/hamburger-menu-icon.png?classes=inline&height=25px) menu button at the end of the Explore Data Pane, if space is at a premium)
3. Recent Pane, This pane shows your recently created or visited Dashboards or Detectors for easy access.
4. Main Menu Pane, this pane allows for quick movement between the components of the Splunk Observability Suite.
5. Org Switcher Pane, allows for switching between different orgs, if you are a member of more then one Org.
6. Expand Menu Pane, This pane allow you to expand the Main menu from icon mode to full mode and vise versa.

Lets do an exercise to get familiar with the menu behaviour, and let's play with some of the UI settings.

* Expand the main menu, check the drop-down box in Org Switcher Pane at the top to see if you have more than one Org assigned to you.
* Click on ![Settings](../images/settings-icon.png?classes=inline&height=25px) in the main menu.
* Select the ![Onboarding](../images/onboarding-icon.png?classes=inline&height=25px)option.  This will open a  dialog that allows you to toggle the visibility of the onboarding panes on and off.
* Give it a try, hide  the Home page content.
* At the bottom of the menu, click on either **Light**, **Dark** or **Auto** mode.
* Did you also notice this is where the  Sign out ![Sign Out](../images/sign-out-icon.png?classes=inline&height=25px) option is?
* Click ![Back to menu](../images/back-main-menu.png?classes=inline&height=25px) to go back to the Main Menu.
