This section is going to be a little longer, as we are using this section to  dive deeper into some of the special features of the Splunk Observability suite, before we use  them to investigate issues in our application further in the workshop.

Please select Splunk Infrastructure from the menu bar on the right by selecting the ![Infra-monitoring](../images/inframon-icon.png?classes=inline&height=25px). This will bring us to the Infrastructure  Home Page. It has 4 distinct sections that provide either useful information you pick or create a Synthetic Test.

* 3. Integration Pane, This pane allows you to select a specific technology set  to focus on when looking at your infrastructure components.
* 4. Details Pane, This pane PRrovides you an over view of all the components from the selected Technology set, also allows for a quick health status of your systems based on the  charts and alert
