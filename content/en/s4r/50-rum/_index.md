Splunk RUM is the industry’s only end-to-end, **NoSample™** RUM solution - providing visibility into the full user experience of every web and mobile session to uniquely combine all front-end traces with back-end metrics, traces, and logs as they happen. IT Operations and Engineering teams can quickly scope, prioritize and isolate errors, measure how performance impacts real users and optimize end-user experiences by correlating performance metrics alongside video reconstructions of all user interactions.

**Full user session analysis:** Streaming analytics capture full user sessions from single and multi-page apps, measuring the customer impact of every resource, image, route change and API call.  
**Correlate issues faster:** Infinite cardinality and full transaction analysis helps you pinpoint and correlate issues faster across complex distributed systems.  
**Isolate latency and errors:** Easily identify latency, errors and poor performance for each code change and deployment. Measure how content, images and third-party dependencies impact your customers.  
**Benchmark and improve page performance:** Leverage core web vitals to measure and improve your page load experience, interactivity and visual stability. Find and fix impactful JavaScript errors, and easily understand which pages to improve first.  
**Explore meaningful metrics:** Instantly visualize the customer impact with metrics on specific workflows, custom tags and auto-suggest un-indexed tags to quickly find the root cause of issues.  
**Optimize end-user experience:** Correlate performance metrics alongside video reconstructions of all user interactions to optimize end-user experiences.
