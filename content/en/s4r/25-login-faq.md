### 1. Invite email or password renewal email not arriving

 The fitsty step to take is to search for an email from **noreply@signalfx.com**, across all you email folders,  as this is the adressee used to send the  invite and password renewal emails. It does happend that   you email filterd  delete or put into spam folders anything from a norply email.

If you are sure the email does not existin i  your email, ask th Instructor to verify the email used  for the workshop and have hime or her resend the invite.

if this fails,an other solution is to provide the Instructeor with  a different email adress like a private or gmail adress as this usually resolves the issue.
