I can see there is a bad token in the deployment of the new version. If we filter by this error message, we see the same issue is causing all of the errors.

Weâ€™ve now been successful in narrowing down the offending service, version of code, and specific errors that were causing the problem.

If I were still in the middle of my investigation I can see some additional content that can take me back to the map or trace or into the infrastructure where these errors are found. Splunk Observability helps to direct me to the right places to find context.
