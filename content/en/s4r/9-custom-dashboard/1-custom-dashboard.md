As we already saved some useful log charts in a dashboard in the Log Observer exercise, we are going to extend that dashboard.

{{% notice title="Exercise" style="green" icon="running" %}}

* Go back to your dashboard with the two log charts, by clicking on **Dashboards*, and select your dashboard group from the list of linked dashboards at the bottom of the page. This should bring you back to your previously saved dashboard.

* Even if the log information is useful, it will need more information to have it make sense for our team so let's add a bit more information
* The first step is adding a description chart to the dashboard. Click on the {{% button style="grey" %}}New text note{{% /button %}} and replace the text in the note with the following text and then click the {{% button style="blue" %}}Save and close{{% /button %}} button and name the chart **Instructions**

* The charts are not in a nice order, let's correct that and rearrange the charts so that they are useful.
* Move your mouse over the top edge of the  *Instructions* chart, your mouse pointer will change to a **â˜©**. This will allow you to drag the chart in the dashboard. Drag the *Instructions* chart to the top left location and resize it to a 1/3rd of the page by dragging the right-hand edge.
* Drag and add the *Log Timeline view* chart next to the *Instruction* chart, resize it so it fills the other 2/3rd of the page to be the error rate chart next to the two the chart and resize it so it fills the page
* Next, resize the *Log lines* chart to be the width of the page and resize it the make it at least twice as long.
* You should have something similar to the dashboard below:

This looks great, let's continue and add more meaningful charts.
