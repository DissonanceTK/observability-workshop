Discover the power of full end-to-end visibility by jumping from a RUM trace (frontend) to an APM trace (backend). All the services are sending telemetry (traces and spans) that Splunk Observability Cloud can visualize, analyze and use to detect anomalies and errors.

RUM and APM are two sides of the same coin. RUM is the client-side view of the application and APM is the server-side view. In this section, we will use APM to drilldown and identify where the problem is.
