Click **RUM** in the main menu, this will bring you to the main RUM Home or Landing page. The main concept of this page is to provide you at a glance, the overall status of all selected RUM applications, either in a full dashboard or the compact view.

Independent of the type of Status Dashboard used, the RUM Home Page is made up of 3 distinct sections:

![RUM Page](../images/rum-main.png)

1. **Onboarding Pane:** Training videos and links to documentation to get you started with Splunk RUM. (You can hide this pane in case you need the screen real estate).
2. **Filter Pane:** Filter on the time frame, environment, application and source type.
3. **Application Summary Pane:** Summary of all your applications that send RUM data.

* Splunk Observability uses the **environments** Tag that is sent as part of the RUM trace, (created with every interaction with your website or Mobile App), to separate data coming from different environments like "Production" or "Development".
* A further separation can be made by the  **Applications** Tag. This allows you allows you to distinguish between separate browser/mobile applications running in the same environment.
* Splunk RUM is available for both browser and mobile applications, you could use **Source Type** to distinguish between them, however for this workshop, we will only use browser-based RUM.

* In the **JavaScript Errors** tile click on the **TypeError** entry that says: *Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'Prcie')* to see more details. Note that you are given a quick indication of the part of the website where the error occurred, allowing you to fix this quickly.
