This wraps up the Splunk for Rookies Workshop of the Splunk Observability Cloud. We were able to:

* Understand what real users were experiencing
* See how we can detect these issues through Detectors, Dashboards and Synthetic Tests
* Troubleshoot a particularly long page load, by following its trace across the front and back end and right to the log entries.
* Use Tag Spotlight, in both RUM and APM, to understand blast radius and context for our performance issues and errors.

Today we didnâ€™t even talk about the power of the rest of Splunk Observability Cloud, such as:

* Infrastructure monitoring, which shows how our infrastructure is behaving -- hosts, Kubernetes, and applications via Dashboards, Navigators and Detectors
* More about Synthetics, which can simulate web and mobile traffic and report on application behavior and potential areas for improvement.
