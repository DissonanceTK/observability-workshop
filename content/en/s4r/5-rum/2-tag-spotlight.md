Click the **Custom Events** tab and have a look at the **Custom Event Latency** chart. The metrics shown here show the application latency. The comparison metrics to the side show the latency compared to 1 hour ago (which is selected in the top filter bar). Click on the **see all** link under the chart title.

In this dashboard view, you are presented with all the tags associated with the RUM data. Tags are key-value pairs that are used to identify the data. In this case, the tags are automatically generated by the OpenTelemetry instrumentation. The tags are used to filter the data and to create the charts and tables. The Tag Spotlight view allows you to drill down into the data and find the root cause of the problem.

Let's drill down on the RUM data we generated earlier.

We now have a User Session table that is sorted by longest duration descending and includes the cities of all the users that have been shopping on the site. We could apply more filters to further narrow down the data e.g. OS version, browser version, etc.
