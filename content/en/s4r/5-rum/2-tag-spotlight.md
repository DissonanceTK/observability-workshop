In this dashboard view, you are presented with all the tags associated with the RUM data. Tags are key-value pairs that are used to identify the data. In this case, the tags are automatically generated by the OpenTelemetry instrumentation. The tags are used to filter the data and to create the charts and tables. The Tag Spotlight view allows you to drill down into a user session.

We now have a User Session table that is sorted by longest duration descending and includes the cities of all the users that have been shopping on the site. We could apply more filters to further narrow down the data e.g. OS version, browser version, etc.
