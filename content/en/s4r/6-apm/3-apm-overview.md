The Overview page provides a high-level view of the health of your application. It includes a summary of the services, latency and errors in your application. It also includes a list of the top services by error rate and the top business workflows by error rate (a business workflow is the start-to-finish journey of the collection of traces associated with a given activity or transaction and enables monitoring of end-to-end KPIs and identifying root causes and bottlenecks).
