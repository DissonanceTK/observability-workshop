You are a **back-end developer** and you have been called in to help investigate an issue found by the SRE. The SRE has identified a poor user experience and has asked you to investigate the issue.

Discover the power of full end-to-end visibility by jumping from a RUM trace (front-end) to an APM trace (back-end). All the services are sending telemetry (traces and spans) that Splunk Observability Cloud can visualize, analyze and use to detect anomalies and errors.

RUM and APM are two sides of the same coin. RUM is the client-side view of the application and APM is the server-side view. In this section, we will use APM to drill down and identify where the problem is.
