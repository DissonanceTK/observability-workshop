We have arrived at the **Trace Waterfall** from the **Trace Analyzer**. A trace is a collection of spans that share the same trace ID, representing a unique transaction handled by your application and its constituent services.

Each span in Splunk APM captures a single operation. Splunk APM considers a span to be an error span if the operation that the span captures results in an error.

Now that we have identified the version of the **paymentservice** that is causing the issue, let's see if we can find out more information about the error. This is where **Related Logs** come in.
