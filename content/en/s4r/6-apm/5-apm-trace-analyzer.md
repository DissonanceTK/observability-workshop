As Splunk APM provides a **NoSampleâ„¢** end-to-end visibility of every service Splunk APM captures every trace. For this workshop, the **Order Confirmation ID** is available as a tag. This means that we can use this to search for the exact trace of the poor user experience you encountered earlier in the workshop.

Splunk Observability Cloud provides several tools for exploring application monitoring data. **Trace Analyzer** is suited to scenarios where you have high-cardinality, high-granularity searches and explorations to research unknown or new issues.

![APM Trace Analyzer Heat Map](../images/apm-trace-analyzer-heat-map.png)

The **Trace Duration** view shows a heatmap of traces by duration.  The heatmap represents 3 dimensions of data:

1. Time on the x-axis
2. Trace duration on the y-axis
3. The traces (or requests) per second are represented by the heatmap shades

You can use your mouse to select an area on the heatmap, to focus on a specific time period and trace duration range.

* Switch from **Trace duration** back to **Trace & Error count**.
* In the time picker select **Last 1 hour**.
* Note, that most of our traces have errors (red) and there are only a limited amount of traces that are error-free (blue).
* Make sure the **Sample Ratio** is set to `1:1` and **not** `1:10`.
* Click on **Add filters**, type in `orderId` and select **orderId** from the list.
* Paste in your **Order Confirmation ID** from when you went shopping earlier in the workshop and hit enter. If you didn't capture one, please ask your instructor for one.

We have now filtered down to the exact trace where you encountered a poor user experience with a very long checkout wait. A secondary benefit to viewing this trace is that the trace will be accessible for up to 13 months. This will allow developers to come back to this issue at a later stage and still view this trace for example.

Next, we will walk through the trace waterfall.
