Tag Spotlight is a powerful capability in Splunk Observability Cloud that helps us make sense of the unique transactions flowing through our application.

Tags can be indexed, both on the service where they originate, as well as globally (covering the entire transaction), to help developers understand more about a subset of the transactions that are occurring.
