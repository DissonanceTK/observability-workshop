For attendees that are taking the **pre-configured workshop**, the application will already be deployed for you and your instructor will provide with a link to the Online Boutique application.

## Let's go shopping

Once you have a link to the Online Boutique have a browse through a few items, add them to your cart, and then checkout.

{{% notice icon="question-circle" style="green" %}}
Did you notice anything about the checkout process? Did it seem to take a while to complete, but it did ultimately complete? Or did you give up?
{{% /notice %}}

This is what a poor user experience feels like and since this is a potential customer satisfaction issue we had better jump on this and troubleshoot.

Letâ€™s go take a look at what this looks like in **Splunk RUM**.
