That wraps up the demo of Splunk Observability Cloud. We were able to:

* Understand what real users were experiencing
* Troubleshoot a particularly long page load, by following it’s trace across the front and back end and right to the log entries
* Use tag spotlight, in both RUM and APM, to understand blast radius and context for our performance issues and errors

Today we didn’t even talk about the power of the rest of Splunk Observability Cloud, such as:

* Infrastructure monitoring, which shows how our infrastructure is behaving -- hosts, kubernetes, and applications
* and more about Synthetics, which can simulate web and mobile traffic and report on application behavior and potential areas for improvement
