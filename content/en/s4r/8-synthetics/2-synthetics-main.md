Before we are going to setup our own synthetic test, lets take a quick tour of the Synthetic UI.  
Select Synthetic from the menu bar on the right (the robot icon) ![Synthetics Icon](../../images/synthetics-icon.png?classes=inline&height=25px)  

This will bring us to the Synthetic Home Page. It has 3 distinct sections that provide either useful information or allows you pick or create a Synthetic Test.
