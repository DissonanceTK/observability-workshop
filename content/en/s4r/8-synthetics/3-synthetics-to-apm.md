{{% notice title="Exercise" style="green" icon="running" %}}

* Make sure you are in an APM trace view
* Validate you see errors, where we got the failure in the *payment* service
* To verify that it's the same error we are seeing, click on the **Related Content** log link
* Repeat the exercise to filter down to errors only
* View the error log to validate the failed payment due to an invalid token.
