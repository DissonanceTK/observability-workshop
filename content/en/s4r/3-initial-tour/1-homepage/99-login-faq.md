 This FAQ will address some of the more common issues we have encountered when logging into the Workshop.

### 1. Invite email or password renewal email not arriving

 The first step to take is to search for an email from **<noreply@signalfx.com>**, across all your email folders, as this is the address used to send the invite and password renewal emails. If you don't see the email, check your spam/junk folder.

If you are sure the email does not exist your email, ask the Instructor to verify the email used for the workshop and have him/her resend the invite.

If this fails, another solution is to provide the Instructor with a different email address (private e-mail address for example) and have him/her resend the invite.
