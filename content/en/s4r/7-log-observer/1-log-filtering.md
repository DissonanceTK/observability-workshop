The Log Observer ui, or LO for short, can be used in multiple ways. In the introduction tour you have used LO **no code interface**   to search for specific entries in your logs. This section however, assumes you have arrived in LO from a viewed trace in APM using the **Related Content** link.
Note that the time window is set to a specific time range that is relevant to the trace which is included in the filter
