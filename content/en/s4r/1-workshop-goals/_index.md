##### 1. Introduction

The goal of this workshop is to experience an issue and use Splunk Observability Cloud to troubleshoot and identify the root cause. For this, we have provided a complete microservices based application running in Kubernetes that has been instrumented to send **metrics, traces, and logs** to Splunk Observability Cloud.

##### 2. OpenTelemetry

A Quick introduction to **why OpenTelemetry** and why is it important for Observability.

##### 3. A tour of the Splunk Observability User Interface

A walkthrough of the various components of Splunk Observability Cloud showing you how to easily navigate the 5 main components:- **Infrastructure, RUM, APM, Logs, and Synthetics**.

##### 4. Using the Online Boutique Website to create traffic

Enjoy some retail therapy using the Online Boutique Website. Use your browser, mobile or tablet to spend some hard-earned virtual money to send **metrics _(do we have a problem?)_, traces _(where is the problem?)_ and logs _(what is the problem?)_**.

##### 5. Splunk Real User Monitoring

Examine the real user data that has been provided by the telemetry received from all participants' browser sessions. The goal is to find a browser, mobile or tablet session that performed poorly and begin the troubleshooting process.

##### 6. Splunk Application Performance Monitoring

Discover the power of **full end-to-end visibility** by jumping from a RUM trace (frontend) to an APM trace (backend). All the services are sending telemetry (traces and spans) that Splunk Observability Cloud can visualize, analyze and use to detect anomalies and errors.

##### 7. Using Logs with Splunk Log Observer

Related Content is a powerful feature that allows you to jump from one component to another. In this case, we will jump from the APM trace to the logs to the related logs.

##### 8. Splunk Synthetics

Wouldn't it be great if we could have **24/7** monitoring of our application, and be **alerted** when there is a problem? This is where Synthetics comes in. We will show you a simple test that will run every 5 minutes and check the health of a typical user journey through the Online Boutique.

##### 9. Wrapping up

Last but not least we will show some of the other features that help find problems before closing the session.
