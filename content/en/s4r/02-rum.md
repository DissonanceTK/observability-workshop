Splunk Real User Monitoring (RUM) allows your teams to quickly identify and eliminate customer-facing issues across your entire architecture.

Splunk RUM collects performance metrics, web vitals, errors, and other forms of data for every user session to enable you to detect and troubleshoot problems in your application.

In Splunk Observability Cloud click on the **RUM** tab in the left navigation bar.

As we know, modern web experiences can appear simple, but are complex, asynchronous systems. Single page applications must accommodate myriad browser and machine types, and apps must interact with many backend services. Only Splunk RUM captures, in full-fidelity, all of the data generated in every user session and presents it to you in a rich and actionable way.

From this page we can see a variety of metrics, such as: highest page load times, number of frontend and backend errors, top pages by views, top endpoints, and Googleâ€™s web vitals metrics. We also get out of the box views for front end health, back end health, and custom events so it's quick to see trends, anomalies, and even create detectors from these views.
