In this workshop we willll be showing how Splunk Observability Cloud provides instant visibility of the user experience – from the perspective of the front end application to its backing services – showing off some of the most compelling product features, and differentiators of the **Splunk Observability Cloud** Suite:

* Complete **end to end** trace visibility with Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
* Real User Monitoring (RUM)
* **NoSample™ Full-fidelity** tracing
* Logs and Metrics
* Finding root-cause with tag analytics and error stacks
* Infinite Cardinality

One of the core tenets in building the Splunk Observability Cloud is unifying telemetry data to build a complete picture of a user’s experience and your application stack.

The workshop uses a microservices based application that is deployed on AWS EC2 instances. The application is a simple e-commerce application that allows users to browse products, add them to a cart, and checkout. The application is instrumented with OpenTelemetry.

OpenTelemetry is a collection of tools, APIs and software development kits (SDKs). Used to instrument, generate, collect and export telemetry data (metrics, logs and traces) to help you analyze your software’s performance and behavior.

The OpenTelemetry community is growing. As a joint project between Splunk, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and many other organizations, it currently has the second-largest number of contributors in the Cloud Native Computing Foundation after Kubernetes.
