You can easily perform log-based analysis and seamlessly correlate your logs with Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring’s real-time metrics and Splunk APM traces in one place.

**End-to-end visibility:** By combining the powerful logging capabilities of Splunk Platform with Splunk Observability Cloud’s traces and real-time metrics for deeper insights and more context of your hybrid environment.  

**Perform quick and easy log-based investigations:** By reusing logs that are already ingested in Splunk Cloud Platform or Enterprise in a simplified and intuitive interface (no need to know SPL!) with customizable and out-of-the-box dashboards  

**Achieve higher economies of scale and operational efficiency:** By centralizing log management across teams, breaking down data and team silos, and getting better overall support
