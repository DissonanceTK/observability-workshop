Click on **Infrastructure** in the main menu, the Infrastructure Home Page is made up of 4 distinct sections.

![Infra main](../images/infrastructure-main.png)

1. **Onboarding Pane:** Training videos and links to documentation to get you started with Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring.
2. **Time & Filter Pane:** Time window (not configurable at the top level)
3. **Integrations Pane:** List of all the technologies that are sending metrics to Splunk Observability Cloud.
4. **Tile Pane:** Total number of services being monitored broken down by integration.

Using the Infrastructure pane, we can select the infrastructure/technology we are interested in, let's do that now.

* Under the **Containers** section in the Integrations Pane (**3**), select **Kubernetes** as the technology you wish to examine.
* This should show you two tiles, **K8s Nodes** and **K8s Workloads**.
* The bottom part of each tile will have a history graph and the top part will show notifications for alerts that fired. Across all tiles, this additional information on each of the tiles will give you a good overview of the health of your infrastructure.
* Click on the **K8s Nodes** tile.
* You will be presented with one or more representations of a Kubernetes Cluster.
* Click on the {{% button %}}Add filters{{% /button %}} button. Type in `k8s.cluster.name` and click on the search result.
* From the list, select **[NAME OF WORKSHOP]-k3s-cluster** then click on the {{% button style="blue" %}}Apply Filter{{% /button %}} button.

* The Kubernetes Navigator uses color to indicate health. As you can see there are two pods or services that are unhealthy and in a Failed state (**1**). The rest are healthy and running. This is not uncommon in shared Kubernetes environments, so we replicated that for the workshop.
* Note the tiles to the side, under **Nodes dependencies** (**2**), specifically the MySQL and Redis tiles. These are the two databases used by our e-commerce application.

The UI will show services that are running on the node you have selected if they have been configured to be monitored by the OpenTelemetry Collector.

* Click on the **Redis** tile and this will take you to the **Redis instances** navigator. Under **REDIS INSTANCE** click on **redis-[NAME OF WORKSHOP]**.
* This will bring you to the **Redis instance**. This navigator will show charts with metric data from the active Redis instance from our e-commerce site.

**Can you name the Instance dependencies tile in this view?**

**Yes, there is one for Kubernetes.**

* Click the tile, it will bring us back into the Kubernetes Navigator, this time at the Pod level showing the Pod that runs the Redis Service.
* To return to the Cluster level, simply click on the link **Cluster** (**1**) at the top of the screen.

This completes the tour of **Splunk Observability Cloud**.

Here, have some virtual ðŸ’¶ and let's go and look at our e-commerce site, the 'Online Boutique' and do some shopping.
