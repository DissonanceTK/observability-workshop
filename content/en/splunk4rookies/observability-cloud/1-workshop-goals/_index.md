**Introduction**  
The goal of this workshop is to give you hands-on experience troubleshooting an issue using Splunk Observability Cloud to identify its root cause. We’ve provided a fully instrumented microservices-based application running on Kubernetes, which sends metrics, traces, and logs to Splunk Observability Cloud for real-time analysis.

**Who Should Attend?**  
This workshop is ideal for anyone looking to gain practical knowledge of Splunk Observability. It's designed for individuals with little or no prior experience with the platform.

**What You’ll Need**  
All you need is your laptop and a browser with access to external websites. The workshop can be attended either in-person or via Zoom. If you don’t have the Zoom client installed, you can still join using your browser.

**Workshop Overview**  
In this 3-hour session, we’ll cover the fundamentals of Splunk Observability—the only platform offering streaming analytics and NoSample Full Fidelity distributed tracing—in an interactive, hands-on setting. Here's what you can expect:

- **OpenTelemetry**  
  Learn why OpenTelemetry is essential for modern observability and how it enhances visibility into your systems.

- **Tour of the Splunk Observability User Interface**  
  Take a guided tour of Splunk Observability Cloud’s interface, where we’ll show you how to navigate the five key components: APM, RUM, Log Observer, Synthetics, and Infrastructure.

- **Generate Real User Data**  
  Dive into a simulated retail experience on the Online Boutique Website. Using your browser, mobile, or tablet, explore the site and generate real user data that includes metrics (Is there a problem?), traces (Where is the problem?), and logs (What’s causing the problem?).

- **Splunk Real User Monitoring (RUM)**  
  Analyze the real user data collected from participants’ browser sessions. Your task is to identify poorly performing sessions and begin the troubleshooting process.

- **Splunk Application Performance Monitoring (APM)**  
  Gain end-to-end visibility by linking a RUM trace (front-end) to an APM trace (back-end). You’ll explore how telemetry from various services is captured and visualized in Splunk Observability Cloud, helping you detect anomalies and errors.

- **Splunk Log Observer (LO)**  
  Learn how to leverage the "Related Content" feature to easily navigate between components. In this case, we’ll move from an APM trace to the related logs for deeper insight into issues.

- **Splunk Synthetics**  
  Discover how Synthetics can help with 24/7 monitoring of your application. We’ll walk you through setting up a simple synthetic test that runs every minute to monitor the performance and availability of the Online Boutique website.

By the end of this session, you'll have gained practical experience with Splunk Observability Cloud and a solid understanding of how to troubleshoot and resolve issues across your application stack.
