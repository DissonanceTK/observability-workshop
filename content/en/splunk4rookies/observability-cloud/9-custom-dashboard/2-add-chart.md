In this section, we are going to use the **Copy and Paste** functionality to extend our dashboard. Remember we copied some charts during the APM Service Dashboard section, we will now add those charts to our dashboard.

{{% notice title="Exercise" style="green" icon="running" %}}

* Select the **2+** at the top of the page and select **Paste charts**, this will create the charts in your custom dashboard.
* The chart currently shows data for all **Environments** and **Services**, so let's add a filter for our environment and the **paymentservice**.
* Click on the 3 dots **...** at the top right side of the **Request Rate** single value chart. This will open the chart in edit mode.
* In the new screen, click on the **x** in the {{% button style="blue" %}}sf_environment:* x{{% /button %}} button (**1**) in the middle of the screen to close it.
* Click on the {{% button style="blue" %}}**+**{{% /button %}}  to add a new filter and select **sf_environment** then pick the [WORKSHOPNAME] from the drop-down and hit **Apply**. The button will change to **sf_environment:[WORKSHOPNAME]**
* Do the same with for the {{% button style="blue" %}}sf_service.{{% /button %}} button (**2**), close it and create a new filter for **sf_service**. Only this time change it to `paymentservice`.

* Click the {{% button style="blue" %}}Save and close {{% /button %}} button (**3**).
* Repeat the previous 4 steps for the **Request Rate** text chart
* Click {{% button style="blue" %}}Save{{% /button %}} after you  have update the two charts.
* As the new pasted charts appeared at the bottom of our dashboard, we need to re-organize our dashboard again.
* Using the drag and drop and resizing skills you learned earlier, make your dashboard look like the image below.

Next, we are going to create a custom chart based on our Synthetic test that is running.
