The API Test provides a flexible way to check the functionality and performance of API endpoints. The shift toward API-first development has magnified the necessity to monitor the back-end services that provide your core front-end functionality.

Whether you're interested in testing multi-step API interactions or you want to gain visibility into the performance of your endpoints, the API Test can help you accomplish your goals.

This excercise will walk through a multi-step test on the Spotify API. You can also use it as an example when you are building tests on your own APIs or on those of your critical third parties.
