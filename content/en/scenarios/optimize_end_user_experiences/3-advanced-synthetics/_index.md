## Introduction

This workshop walks you through using the [Chrome DevTools Recorder](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/recorder/) to create a synthetic test on a Splunk demonstration environment or on your own public website.

The exported JSON from the Chrome DevTools Recorder will then be used to create a Splunk Synthetic Monitoring Real Browser Test.

## Pre-requisites

- Google Chrome Browser installed
- Publicly browser-accessible URL
- Access to Splunk Observability Cloud
