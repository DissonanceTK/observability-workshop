Let's quickly set up some tests in Synthetics to immediately start understanding our end user experience.

We can capture not only the performance and availability of our own apps and endpoints, but also those third parties we rely on.

If you find that your tests are being bot-blocked, see the docs for [tips on how to allow Synthetics testing](https://docs.splunk.com/observability/en/synthetics/test-config/synth-configure-app.html) and [private location instructions](https://docs.splunk.com/observability/en/synthetics/test-config/private-locations.html) if needed to test something internal.
