With RUM instrumented, you will be able to better understand your end users, what they are doing, and what issues they are encountering. 

This workshop walks through how our demo site is instrumented and how to interpret the data. If you already have a RUM license, this will still help you understand how RUM works and how you can use it to optimize your end user experience.
