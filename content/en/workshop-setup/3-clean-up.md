## Workshop Clean-up

Once you have completed your workshop session please remember to go back and clean up the environment using **SWiPE**. Also, ensure your workshop instances are deleted to save costs.

**SWiPE** will complete the following:

- Delete all the users associated with the workshop
- Delete the team
- Delete the tokens (INGEST, API and RUM)
- Delete user dashboards

**SWiPE** also provides some advanced features for deleting tokens and detectors etc., and these must be used with caution.

**Happy Workshopping!**
